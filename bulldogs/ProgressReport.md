# Progress Report

## Obstacles we encountered
- Finding a good time to meet up.
- Some charts had incorrect descriptions.
- Some charts are impractical to convert because the backend doesn't / didn't send data well.
- Deciding where the boundaries of our project ought to be and what is scope creep.

## What we achieved
- We worked consistently at our problems.
- Started working with the backend to send API information correctly to the new frontend.
- Redesigned most existing charts as Google Charts which receive said information.
- Started assembling it all together.

## Goals for the future
- Ensuring our code is well documented.
- *Mostly* bug-free.
- Everyone does their part in coding.
- Work on sending data for more charts.
- Finish redesigning the remaining charts as Google Charts.
- Ensuring that chart information is read into the charts correctly and that it appears on a webpage nicely.
